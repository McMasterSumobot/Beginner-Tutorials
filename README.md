# **McMaster Sumobot - Junior Competition Resources**
Welcome to the homepage of the McMaster Sumobot sample code for Junior competitors! The projects are broken down into sections that introduce you to coding in the Arduino language, as well as going through the basic design stages for implementing your code.

### Examples
The below examples are designed to give you an intro to the arduino language, as well as provide a generic skeleton for your fully implemented code.

1. [The Basics - Qrds](https://github.com/McMasterSumobot/Beginner-Tutorials/tree/master/qrd_example)
  - Covers the absolute basics of Arduino. Code structure, pin assignments, and serial printing
2. [Arduino Methods - Motors](https://github.com/McMasterSumobot/Beginner-Tutorials/tree/master/motor_example)
  - Builds on the basics and introduces you to writing functions, and the types of pins on the Arduino Uno
3. [Libraries & Headers - Ultrasonic Sensors](https://github.com/McMasterSumobot/Beginner-Tutorials/tree/master/ultrasonic_example)
  - Shows you how to use external libraries in an Arduino project
4. [Statemachine - Generic Outline](https://github.com/McMasterSumobot/Beginner-Tutorials/tree/master/state_machine_example)
  - Focus on writing your own C++ class (Arduino Library) that you can then use in your project
